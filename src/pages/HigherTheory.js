            <h1>Musical Intervals</h1>
            <p>Musical intervals are the distance between any 2 notes. The minimum distance between two notes is called halftone or color notes. In order to facilitate the understanding of the different concepts, we give an alphabetical denomination to the different musical notes. It is generally applied for the table system or the so-called American encryption.</p>
            <p>In order to understand harmony, we must consider black and white equally. As long as there is no middle note, either black or white, between two selected notes, the distance is one semitone. This is the minimum unit of measurement for the instrument for harmony learning purposes.</p>
            <p className='note'>Note: It is important to practice chords in the various keys in order to quickly identify harmony and melody whenever you need to play. It is also recommended to keep them in mind since later we will incorporate different notes to each chord until we manage to use chords of 4,5,6,7 and up to 8 notes each.</p>
            <p className='tt'>Modes</p>
            <p>The C Major scale is formed with the following notes: C-D-E-F-G-A-B. This is so because in the diatonal system the major scales are formed according to the following harmonic structure: The intervals corresponding to the major scale are Tone-Tone-Semitone-Tone-Tone-Tone-Semitone.</p>
            <p className='tt'>Progressions</p>
            <p>In order to better understand the chord sequence or progressions, it is important to be clear, as we have already seen, that the 3rd. and the 7th. of each they determine the quality of the chord.</p>
